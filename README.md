## Background


## Objective Assignment


## Navigation
I had a more interesting method of navigation, but it wasn't as flexible as I wanted. Eventually I broke down and did what I think was pretty standard. I used the starter bot collision detection, with the tweak for double motion where you just switch into the reference frame of one of the bots. I then generated all nav options up to 90 degrees in each direction and tossed them into a heap with dist to target as the comparison function. I then pulled off the top of the heap until I found one that wasn't blocked by any planets or ships close enough to matter. Simple but effective. I could've made this run much faster, but I was managing memory poorly.

## Combat
Open space combat I think I did particularly well in. 

## Rushes


## Harrass
To my knowledge I started this, but someone else would've done it eventually. I got the idea from a probe harrass in SC2. You attack their workers and they either let you or they try to defend. For a long time, people had trouble reacting proportionately to the threat so this would wind up kiting a bunch of ships around while I macro'd up on the other side of the board. Once people caught on to defending minimally, this mattered less.


## Desertion
I hate this. I hate that this is incentivized. I had to do something for this, but I didn't want to. I decided if I have half of the ships of the largest player (and largest > 40) just get out. I hade two modes of retreat based on what place I was going to be in: turtle all my ships into a corner or circle the map.
